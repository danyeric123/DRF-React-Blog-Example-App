## Description
This is a simple blog app that uses Django REST Framework and React with TypeScript. You can read other people's blog posts, create and edit your own blog posts, and sign in with JWT Auth. 

### Motivation
I wanted to make something relatively simple to learn and delve deep into Django REST Framework and to get more practice using React with TypeScript. Some of the inspiration is taken from [Very Academy's video on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfYfvjP1hK8), but I devianted in several ways to better explore and learn the different technologies I was using.

## Next Steps
This is a project in its early stages and has not been deployed yet. The hope is to work on this more and deploy it.
